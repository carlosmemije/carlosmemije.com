## About

I am currently a full-time student studying computer science who enjoys designing and building software that can give users a greater experience. I am learning the most I can, but mainly appreciate the front-end development and math aspect of computer science. Not only that, but I love high-paced collaborative work, appreciate minimal clean code, every code language out there, and testing API. Other big interests I am passionate about are reading, computers, music and most importantly knowledge.
